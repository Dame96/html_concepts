# html_concepts
HI TEAM! WELCOME TO MY HTML 5 BASIC CONCEPTS PROJECT!
THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ASSIGNMENT WAS TO USE THE CONCEPTS LEARNED IN MODULE 4 TO CREATE AN HTML PAGE DISPLAYING forms, tables, navigation bars, and images.

Using what I learned I was able to create a page with a form where users will share their contact information and indicate how they located this site. I also impletemented a table with sample apple products and a nav bar so users can move freely around the site to see more info about us and locate our contact information to reach out and share feedback or any questions and concerns they may have.
